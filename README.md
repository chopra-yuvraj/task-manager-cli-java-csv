## Why Task Manager CLI?

While studying technology at VIT, I grew tired of complex task management apps that took longer to set up than actually completing the tasks. 
This CLI tool is my answer to that frustration - a **no-nonsense, lightning-fast command-line interface** that manages your tasks and gets out of your way.

### Key Features
**Four Simple Commands** - Add, List, Complete, Delete. That's it.  
**Local Storage** - Your data stays yours (CSV format)  
**Smart Prioritisation** - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW priority levels  
**Due Date Tracking** - Never miss deadlines again  
**Cross Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher ([Download here](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/))
- A terminal/command prompt
- 2 minutes of your time


## How to Use

### Basic Commands

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `help` | Show all commands | `java -cp out com.yuvraj.taskmanager.Main help` |
| `add` | Create a new task | `java -cp out com.yuvraj.taskmanager.Main add "Study for exam"` |
| `list` | Show all tasks | `java -cp out com.yuvraj.taskmanager.Main list` |
| `done` | Mark task complete | `java -cp out com.yuvraj.taskmanager.Main done 1` |
| `delete` | Remove task forever | `java -cp out com.yuvraj.taskmanager.Main delete 1` |

## Future Ideas

While this CLI is designed to stay simple, here are some ideas being considered:

- [ ] **Task Categories/Tags** - Organize tasks by project
- [ ] **Search Functionality** - Find tasks quickly
- [ ] **Recurring Tasks** - Daily/weekly repeating tasks
- [ ] **Color Output** - Better visual feedback in terminal
